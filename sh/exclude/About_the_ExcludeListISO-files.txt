About the ExcludeListISO-*.txt files

   This file explains the translation of the ExcludeListISO-*.txt files
   from Windows to Linux.

   The Windows script CreateISOImage.cmd uses mkisofs.exe, while the
   Linux script create-iso-image.bash uses mkisofs or genisoimage,
   depending on the distribution. So the format of the filter files
   should basically be the same. Still, there seem to be some
   differences in the handling of paths, and the Windows files cannot
   easily be used on Linux.

General filter rules

   Filters in the files ExcludeListISO-*.txt can be:

     * just the file or directory name
     * a complete path, relative to the sh directory

   For example, the following filters exclude two unneeded source files
   and all download directories except the wsus directory:

   o2k10
   o2k13
   o2k16
   ofc
   w60
   w60-x64
   w61
   w61-x64
   w62-x64
   w63
   w63-x64
   w100
   w100-x64
   win
   cpp
   dotnet
   msse
   wddefs
   UpdateInstaller.au3
   IfAdmin.cpp

   Paths must be complete paths, relative to the sh directory. The above
   filters could also be written as:

   ../client/o2k10
   ../client/o2k13
   ../client/o2k16
   ../client/ofc
   ../client/w60
   ../client/w60-x64
   ../client/w61
   ../client/w61-x64
   ../client/w62-x64
   ../client/w63
   ../client/w63-x64
   ../client/w100
   ../client/w100-x64
   ../client/win
   ../client/cpp
   ../client/dotnet
   ../client/msse
   ../client/wddefs
   ../client/UpdateInstaller.au3
   ../client/bin/IfAdmin.cpp

   Subdirectories can be specified with the name of the last directory
   or with a complete path. The filters:

   x86-glb
   x64-glb

   match the subdirectories:

   ../client/dotnet/x86-glb
   ../client/dotnet/x64-glb
   ../client/msse/x86-glb
   ../client/msse/x64-glb
   ../client/wddefs/x86-glb
   ../client/wddefs/x64-glb

   Shell pattern can be used as needed. In pathnames, one asterisk '*'
   can replace one directory level. The path:

   ../client/dotnet/x86-glb

   could also be specified as:

   */client/dotnet/x86-glb
   */*/dotnet/x86-glb

   However, the Linux files ExcludeListISO-*.txt don't use any paths,
   because they are not needed. Using only the file and directory names,
   and inserting shell patterns only when needed, seems to work best.

Obsolete Office and Windows versions

   In the current version of WSUS Offline Update, the following
   directories can always be excluded:

   o2k
   oxp
   o2k3
   o2k7
   o2k7-x64
   o2k10
   w2k
   wxp
   w2k3
   w2k3-x64
   w62

   These directory names correspond to: Office 2000, Office XP (aka
   Office 2002), Office 2003, Office 2007, Office 2010, Windows 2000,
   Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows 8 (32-bit).

Supported Office versions

   All supported Office versions can be excluded with the directory
   names:

   o2k13
   o2k16
   ofc

   These filters are used for the creation of the ExcludeListISO-*.txt
   files for single Windows versions.

Supported Windows versions

   All supported Windows versions can be excluded with the directory
   names:

   w60
   w60-x64
   w61
   w61-x64
   w62-x64
   w63
   w63-x64
   w100
   w100-x64
   win

   This filter block is used in the file ExcludeListISO-all-ofc.txt.

Excluding 64-bit files and directories

   If an ISO image with only 32-bit downloads is created, then the
   following directories with 64-bit downloads should be excluded:

   w60-x64
   w61-x64
   w62-x64
   w63-x64
   w100-x64
   x64-glb

   The filter x64-glb matches the 64-bit subdirectories of dotnet, msse
   and wddefs.

   The directories cpp and win/glb contain both 32-bit and 64-bit
   downloads. The filter:

   *_x64.exe

   excludes these files:

   ../client/win/glb/Silverlight_x64.exe
   ../client/cpp/vcredist2005_x64.exe
   ../client/cpp/vcredist2008_x64.exe
   ../client/cpp/vcredist2010_x64.exe
   ../client/cpp/vcredist2012_x64.exe
   ../client/cpp/vcredist2013_x64.exe
   ../client/cpp/vcredist2017_x64.exe

   32-bit and 64-bit Office updates are also downloaded to the same
   directories. The file ExcludeListISO-all-x86.txt uses the filter:

   *-fullfile-x64-*

   to exclude 64-bit Office downloads in the 32-bit cross-product ISO
   image file.

Excluding 32-bit files and directories

   If an ISO image with for a 64-bit Windows version is created, then
   the following directories with 32-bit downloads should be excluded:

   w60
   w61
   w63
   w100
   x86-glb

   The filter x86-glb matches the 32-bit subdirectories of dotnet, msse
   and wddefs.

   The remaining rules are not simply the reverse of the above, because
   64-bit Windows versions may still need some 32-bit installers:

     * Windows Server 2008 in 32-bit and 64-bit (w60 and w60-x64) both
       need the 32-bit version of Silverlight. Therefore the file
       ExcludeListISO-w60-x64.txt excludes Silverlight_x64.exe, but not
       Silverlight_x86.exe (as might be expected).

     * 64-bit Windows versions may need both 32-bit and 64-bit
       installers for the Visual C++ runtime libraries, to support
       applications in both architectures.

Handling of .NET Frameworks

   Old, unsupported .NET Frameworks are excluded from download with the
   files ExcludeList-dotnet-x86.txt and ExcludeList-dotnet-x64.txt. Then
   the same filters don't need to be included in the files
   ExcludeListISO-*.txt.

   The Windows files ExcludeListISO-all-x86.txt and
   ExcludeListISO-all-x64.txt exclude installers and dynamic updates for
   .NET Framework 3.5. But these cross-product ISO images are supposed
   to support all Windows versions, and then the .NET Framework 3.5 may
   be needed. Therefore, the filters *dotnetfx35* and *ndp3* are not
   used in the Linux files ExcludeListISO-all-x86.txt and
   ExcludeListISO-all-win-x64.txt.

   The Windows files ExcludeListISO-w60-x86.txt and
   ExcludeListISO-w60-x64.txt exclude installers and dynamic updates
   for .NET Framework 4.8. These filters are kept in the Linux files.

   The Windows files ExcludeListISO-w61-x86.txt,
   ExcludeListISO-w61-x64.txt, ExcludeListISO-w62-x64.txt,
   ExcludeListISO-w63-x86.txt, ExcludeListISO-w63-x64.txt,
   ExcludeListISO-w100-x86.txt and ExcludeListISO-w100-x64.txt exclude
   .NET Frameworks 3.5 and 4.5. They also exclude the installers but
   not dynamic updates for .NET Framework 4.6.

   I don't really understand, why the installers for .NET Framework 4.6
   are excluded, but not dynamic updates for the same version. Maybe this
   was done, to keep the size of the ISO images slightly smaller. But
   for compatibility with the Windows scripts, I just kept these
   filters. If needed, these filters can be disabled in local copies of
   the ExcludeListISO-*.txt files (see below).

Virus definition files for Windows 8

   The integrated Defender of Windows 8 and higher needs the same virus
   definition files as Microsoft Security Essentials, but without the
   installers. The old virus definitions for the Defender of Windows 7
   cannot be used. Therefore, two filters are added for Window 8 - 10:

   wddefs
   MSEInstall-*.exe

Unneeded files from the directory client/static

   In Windows, some of the files StaticUpdateIds-*.txt may be excluded,
   but this is rather a side-effect of excluding unneeded directories.

   The approach for Linux is to keep all basic files of a wsusoffline
   installation, and to exclude only new downloaded or created files.

   In the first versions of the ExcludeListISO-*.txt files, the file
   wsusoffline/client/static/StaticUpdateFiles-modified.txt was excluded,
   but this file was moved to wsusoffline/static/sdd in the Community
   Editions 11.9.2-ESR and 12.1.

Source files

   Two source files are included, because the GPL demands, that the
   source code of all tools should be made available somewhere. These
   files are never needed for end users, neither for download nor for
   installation:

   UpdateInstaller.au3
   IfAdmin.cpp

Comments

   Empty lines and lines, which start with a number sign '#', are
   removed by the script create-iso-image.bash. This is just an inverted
   grep:

   grep -v -e "^$" -e "^#" ExcludeListISO-all.txt

   The ISO image creation tools mkisofs and genisoimage themselves don't
   support comments.

Local ExcludeListISO-*.txt files

   The supplied files ExcludeListISO-*.txt are installed in the
   directory:

   sh/exclude

   Users can create copies of these files in the directory:

   sh/exclude/local

   Local files replace the supplied files. This is different from the
   handling of custom files in WSUS Offline Update, but it is more the
   Linux way, and it allows to both add and remove filters.

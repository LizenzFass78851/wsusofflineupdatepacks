# The two "x64-cross-product" ISO images don't exclude any .NET
# Frameworks, because they are supposed to support all Windows
# versions. Dynamic updates for obsolete versions are already excluded
# in the files wsusoffline/exclude/ExcludeList-dotnet-x86.txt and
# ExcludeList-dotnet-x64.txt. The .NET Framework 3.5 should not be
# excluded, because it may still be installed on Window Vista / Server
# 2008 and possibly other Windows versions.

# Exclude unneeded files from the directory client/md
